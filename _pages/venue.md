Aveiro is a coastal city located in the central region of Portugal, which is 5 minutes from the Atlantic beaches.
The Ria de Aveiro is a salt lake that follows the coastline for 45 km, providing a unique habitat for wildlife and is at the genesis of the city due to the production of salt. Aveiro is today a modern city, driven by the active academic life of its students.

Aveiro has today a very relevant tourist activity with numerous interesting things to visit and do. Tourist information can be found [here](https://www.visitportugal.com/en/content/visit-aveiro). You can also take a look at this
